# Online-Bookstore: Multi-threading (Java)
A micro-service framework implementation of an online book store with a delivery option.\
In the Micro-Services architecture, complex applications are composed of small and independent services which are able to communicate with each other using
messages. The Micro-Service architecture allows us to compose a large program from a collection of smaller independent parts.\
\
This project is composed of two main sections:
1. Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
2. Implementing an online books store application on top of this framework.
